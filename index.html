    <div id="music-intro" class="message-box">Here're some of my piano recordings back to the time I'm still a piano enthusiast. However, as I'm getting more and 
        more interested and good at it, it leads to a quite unsatifactory result and scary fact that, learning a piano or say making musics is actually a quite 
        negative thing to do. Because you are sit down and spending all these time with a note book. You are absolutely missing everything and staying distracted. 
        You isolated yourself without communication to nobody. Or choose to gain some useful skill-sets that will develop you into a man in this modern society. 
        It does zero or even negative contributes to my life. So, as being a young man trapped in his past missed some of his opportunities, he began to review 
        himself and start make some decisions. He knews, ignoring God and the universe will not bring him any success but will not estroy him. He chose to become 
        a better version of himself. Instead of having these pleasures absolutely doing nothing. I should really start to living my life and engage myself with 
        good people. I know I'm not born rich, so, and I know nothing comes as easy as it look like. Anyway, listening to these musics are not as much as you 
        literally practicing and writing them. So, I should say please feel free to listen and enjoy your life, thanks!</div>
